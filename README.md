# Hacktionary - A guide to the tech startup world.
I own hacktionary.com and will be using this repository to generate content for a new website. The Hacktionary project will be an open source living guide to the tech startup scene. It will be approachable by those who are not familiar with the scene and those in the bubble who want to learn more about running a tech startup. The content will cover tech/hacker jargon, common entreprenurial lingo, digital marketing concepts and terms used by the angel investor/venture capital world.

This repository is open source so that it can be augmented and modified by anyone. I will take contributions as pull requests and merge them in after review.
