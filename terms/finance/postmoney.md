# Post-money valuation
A post-money valuation is the value of a company determined during an investment round, including the incoming investment itself. During an investment, new shares are issued
which dilutes down the previous investors. So the post-money valuation would be total amount of money invested, multiplied by the total number of shares
(including the newly issued shares for the investment), divded by the newly issued shares.
